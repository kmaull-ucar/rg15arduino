# Arduino Library for Serial communication with the Hydreon RG-15 Rain Sensor library

This library was source originally from :

* [https://rainsensors.com/docs/rg-guides/rg-arduino/hydreon-arduino-library/](https://rainsensors.com/docs/rg-guides/rg-arduino/hydreon-arduino-library/)


It was modified to compile on ESP32 chips.  A single line of code change was made.

The code base is compatible with [openIoTwx](https://ncar.github.io/openiotwx).
